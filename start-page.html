      <h1>WELCOME TO PRIMARY</h1>
      <p>PRIMARY is a story revolving around three best friends - <span style="color: #d62314">Primo</span>, <span style="color: #1883cf">Maddox</span>, and <span style="color: #fecb17">Rylie</span> - who grew up together in a small town called Yelross. It is set in the year 2116, and it explores their pasts, as well as the highs and lows they encounter as they grow up and apart.
      Each of the three best friends has a story to tell - but is it only about their own?
      <br><br>

      <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
      <p>PRIMARY is a non-linear web based hypertext story. Throughout the story, options are presented in the form of hyperlinks. This page is equipped with a player for the background music (I Know The End, by Phoebe Bridgers), which you may use to mute, pause, or play. Please do not close this tab when the story begins.
      <br><br>
      At the end of this page, you will be presented with the audio player, as well as a palette where you may choose your PRIMARY (the character you would like to play). Worry not, though, as you will be given many opportunities to switch between characters and read through their stories throughout this hypertext fiction piece. 
      <br><br>
      There will be multiple types of hyperlinks in this story, all of which are underlined:
      </p>
      <ol type="1"> 
        <li>
      As mentioned above, there will be POV-change hyperlinks. These links allow you to switch from one character’s perspective to another. POV-change links mention the character’s name, and are in the color that represents the character.
        </li>
        <li>
      Continue hyperlinks. These hyperlinks are the same color as the text, but when you hover your mouse over them, they change to the color gray.
        </li>
        <li>
      Next-page hyperlinks are hyperlinks that will take you to the next page of your chosen character’s story. Like continue hyperlinks, they are black in color - but when hovered over, they change into the color that represents the character.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Choose wisely, as the choices you make will affect the ending that you get. Enjoy your PRIMARY experience!
