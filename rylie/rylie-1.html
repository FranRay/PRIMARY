        If I could describe the essence of my being in one word, it would be ‘constant’. For better or for worse, that is what I have always been – to people in my life, and with how I choose to live my own. Sometimes I wonder if that’s a good thing or not, especially since it makes me fear any change that tries to make its way into my normal.
        <br><br>
        My grandma’s flower shop has been my biggest constant. She took me in when I was barely old enough to mutter a single sensible word. I grew up in that store and sometimes I think I know more flower species than other human names. 
        <br><br>
        Another constant is my friends. I only have two of them but I think that’s enough to keep me going. Have…? Had…? I- whatever, that doesn’t matter. Or at least, it hasn’t had to matter for a long time.
        <br><br>
        I met both of them in the same flower shop. <a class="primo" href="../primo/primo-1.html">Primo</a>, the ambitious one, talked to me first. He noticed the old Captain America toy I was holding and he told me I was cool. I think if he were a colour, he would be red. 
        <br><br>
        And then I met <a class="maddox" href="../maddox/maddox-1.html">Maddox</a> when she burst into the store panicking and telling us to hide her somewhere. Apparently, she was running away from something really bad she did to her parents. That’s weird, I don’t think she ever told me what it was about <button onclick="show();">after all this time</button>.
