        Art has helped me get through a lot of things in my life. All the adventure that I’d missed out on, I created myself. 
        <br><br>
        Oh, actually – I did get to experience an adventure once! I was sharing my paintings to Holo Gram and a prominent artist reached out to me. He was based in South Africa and he wanted to invite me to a big upcoming gallery he was hosting. 
        <br><br>
        I’m not an idiot and for a while I really did think he was some weird catfish scammer that was trying to social engineer his way into what little money I have saved up. In hindsight, I don’t know why scammers would target me specifically when I check no “prime target with potentially lots of money” boxes. I am not old, not middle class, and definitely not rich.
        <br><br>
        Luckily, it turns out he was legit and I had an amazing time there. The trip made me nauseous but that’s probably only because the only modes of transportation I’ve ever taken were cars, buses, and the occasional bike. I saw Takashi Murakami, Yoshitomo Nara, and Jean-Michel Basquiat’s pieces up-close. 
        <br><br>
        For a second, I wondered what it would be like to live a life surrounded by art. Painting things for a living, showing them to people at galleries, and <button onclick="show();">telling them about your work</button>.
