        We were unstoppable, the three of us. We explored virtually every nook and cranny of that old run-down town. Ask any of us and we could probably give you a detailed map of where everything is off the top of our heads. 
        <br><br>
        That’s kind of why I decided to leave. When you’ve seen everything there is in a tiny area, you start to get sick of the things you pass by and the people you’re around. 
        <br><br>
        But not Maddox and Rylie, I don’t think I’d get sick of them in any lifetime I live. So why the hell did I leave without saying a word?
        <br><br>
        One story I keep retelling to myself is the day <a class="maddox" href="../maddox/maddox-2.html">Maddox</a> finally convinced us to go surfing. We were… what, 16? 17? Rylie almost drowned because he fell in the water trying to stand up on the surfboard. There was a moment that day, I can’t pinpoint exactly what - but that was when everything sank in. They were the ones holding me down. We understood each other to the deepest level I knew how to grasp, and we stood by each other through every uphill battle and downward slope. 
        <br><br>
        Actually, that moment was probably when I was watching <a class="rylie" href="../rylie/rylie-2.html">Rylie</a> choke out the water from his lungs and out his quivering mouth. He gasped for air and gripped Maddox’s arm so tight, it turned almost white. All we could do was laugh and <button onclick="show();">call him an idiot</button>.
