        Sometime after leaving, I found a way to start a small tech company and it eventually grew big.
        <br><br>
        It made my mom happy, I don’t think I ever was. Though, it did feel good to finally pay her back for raising me all on her own. But I can’t shake the thought that says ever since I left, the hole that was once never there started growing bigger than my own body. I knew growing up was hard, but I didn't know it was this hard.

        Great. Even more bullshit. Not even in the comfort of my own home can I escape the crazy things people are capable of puking out their mouths. 50,000 bombs is a big number, World News. 
        <br><br>
        “Do you really think that woman would be dumb enough to push that button and delete the entire planet… tsk.”, I say out loud to no one but myself. My voice echoes and bounces against the walls - even with furniture and a shit ton of weird tech sculptures, I cannot escape loneliness.

        I wonder what <a class="rylie" href="../rylie/rylie-3.html">Rylie</a> and <a class="maddox" href="../maddox/maddox-3.html">Maddox</a> have to say about this.
