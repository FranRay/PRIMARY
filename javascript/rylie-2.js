  Sometimes, I do get jealous of Primo and <a class="maddox" href="../maddox/maddox-2.html">Maddox</a>. They got to leave town and do the things they actually wanted to do. I never even got the chance to think about what I wanted because for so long I thought there was nothing else for me that was bigger than Yelross.

  Sometimes, I think about how completely unfair the entire thing was. I can’t blame them for what they did because God knows I’d leave this place too given the chance, but I also can’t just ignore how betrayed I felt when it all went down. At least Maddox had the decency and the heart to say goodbye to me – <a class="primo" href="../primo/primo-2.html">Primo</a> just up and left without a single word to anyone and <a class="next" href="../rylie/rylie-3.html">it crushed me</a> more than I would like to admit.
