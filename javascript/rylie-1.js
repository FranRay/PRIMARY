 You know, I’d be lying if I said I never dreamt of being in another place outside of this town. Maybe even in another time. 
 <br><br>
  Sometimes being a constant is a terrible thing. I feel like a rock that’s bound to where it’s sitting for all of eternity. But, I mean, it’s not like I ever really had a choice. I’m always happy to help my grandma, but I also can’t help but feel there’s more to life than working at a flower shop in a small town.
  <br><br>
  I don’t know… I just feel so incredibly stuck.  I dream of adventure and waking up to new things, but I also get unreasonably overwhelmed when anything changes and disrupts my constant.
  <br><br>
  Maybe that’s why I like painting so much. It lets me create new things without ever having to change anything about myself. The dreams and adventures that I so desperately want to see, they come to life by the grace of my own hands - and I can stare into another world that sits so close to me that I can touch it with my fingertips, yet so far away that I can’t go through a million lifetimes for it to truly exist in <a class="next" href="../rylie/rylie-2.html">my reality</a>.
