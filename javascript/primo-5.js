  I hear two people laughing by the door. For some ungodly reason, my first instinct was to hide and cower.  
  <br><br>
  “Hey Annabelle, just forgot my jacket. Did I leave it by the coat rack?”, Rylie shouts to the register. The counter is empty. Annabelle’s probably inside scolding Frank for burning the eggs.
  <br><br>
  “It’s right there by our table, idiot.” Maddox sighs.
  <br><br>
  “You sounded like Primo just then.”
  <br><br>
  A silence falls between them. They still talk about me?
  <br><br>
  “Anyway we’d better get going, thanks again!”, Rylie shouts again - still to an empty register.
  <br><br>
  I follow them outside, follow the sound of comfort and laughter and love. ‘It’s not too late to go up to them and say hi’, my brain thinks. Yes, it is. It’s way past late. It’s 8 years way too fucking late.
  <br><br>
  I check the time - 6:25 pm. 5 minutes past that stupid end-of-the-world conspiracy people have been talking about for an entire year. I look back up and see them get into a car. Not long after, it was just me. There I stood, under a pale thin tree, watching what used to be my entire life drive away into the distance.

  I really should’ve sent that text.
