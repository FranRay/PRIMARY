        There are many things in my life that I wish I didn’t do. 
        <br><br>
        I wish I didn't go with that random man I met online and followed him to his vacation home in the Bahamas. I wish I asked for directions when I took that hiking trip in Hawai’i. I really wish I didn’t respond to my ex-girlfriend when she called me at 3 am out of nowhere.
        <br><br>
        The one thing you will never hear me regret is meeting Primo and Rylie. Maybe it’s because I met them when I was so young that I barely even knew what regret was. More likely, it’s because I met the people that I felt would pay attention to who I was no matter what.
        <br><br>
        I won’t even bother to recall the days I actually met those two. I think I met <a class="primo" href="../primo/primo-1.html">Primo</a> somewhere in a playground? A slide? A park? Definitely something about me riding a slide. He was a lot nicer to me when we were younger. 
        <br><br>
        And I think I met <a class="rylie" href="../rylie/rylie-1.html">Rylie</a> at a shop somewhere… Flowers…? His grandma’s flower shop! Oh my god, it was when I ran away from home to escape my parents because I made a giant dent in one of our cars trying to play with a new AR helicopter toy thing. Wow. I was a nasty kid. 
        <br><br>
        All this to say, I’m beyond thankful for them. There’s not a lot I want to remember about being younger because it was all just so… tiring. There was a lot of trying to get my parent’s attention (good AND bad), I remember that. Lots of trying to just get them to have a basic conversation with me that wasn’t about what the next thing I wanted to buy was. Lots of running away from home scared of the consequences of my actions, and lots of coming back to find out that they didn’t even notice or care about those actions. 
        <br><br>
        Affection just came in the form of new delivery boxes every 3 days and money I didn’t even know what to do with. When I was 13, I ran away to a beach that was a 1-hour drive away from Yelross. I came home and ordered an entire surfing kit - a surfboard, a wetsuit, a board bag, the basics. <a class="next" href="../maddox/maddox-2.html"> Maybe that’s another thing I don’t regret.</a>
