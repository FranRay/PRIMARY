        I go to win that surfing tournament. And the one after that, and the 5 other ones after that.
        <br><br>
        I didn’t know crowd surfing was even a thing anymore but I had no time to think about it because my coach just decided to lift me up into the air and the next thing I knew, I was being carried by a bunch of strangers on nothing but their grimy little surfer hands. 
        <br><br>
        It was nice. Turns out the end of the world thing didn’t even happen. I remember driving to the airport that day and when I checked the time, it was 10 minutes after it was supposed to happen. I was on-edge for a day or two but I managed to just forget about it. And apparently <button onclick="show()">the issue solved itself</button>.
