        After leaving to another country, I vowed to myself to stop thinking about regret at all. I wanted to do things and face the aftermath with a bold smile on my face - no matter how embarrassing or scary or weird it was. I met so many new people, surfed so many waves, slept in so many rooms, and took so many chances.
        <br><br>
        And here I am now, 18 years later, back in the same town. I’ve never felt such a confusing mix of emotions while walking down the street. There’s some I can’t even describe. The few that I can understand are: pain, guilt, nostalgia, anger, warmth, and… fear? I don’t know.
        <br><br>
        All of this just reminds me of how <a class="primo" href="../primo/primo-2.html">Primo left Yelross</a> just a few months after turning 18 and how much I resented him for it. There were so many things I wanted to say to him when I found out. In the end, I decided against reaching out. I don’t really blame him, at some point the town just sucks the life out of you. I just really wish he’d have told us - or literally anyone.
        <br><br>
        Thanks I guess because it made it a lot easier to leave. Thanks for being the first one to go because I really thought it was going to be me.

        I go inside this vintage store close to where I used to live. My eyes catch this record of Phoebe Bridgers’ album “Punisher” from 2020, almost a century ago. I have that same record. It was in my mom’s vinyl collection and I skipped to a random part - the song “I Know the End”. I remember telling Primo and Rylie all about it and how it sounded like a song that felt like what you would hear at the beginning of the apocalypse, especially the screaming at the end (that was a nice touch, Ms. Bridgers).
        <br><br>
        Ultimately, I don’t end up buying anything. I think I already owned half the records in that store, and the other ones I just wasn’t interested in. As I was about to leave, I bumped into--and I swear I’m not tripping on anything when I say this--<a class="rylie" href="../rylie/rylie-3.html">Rylie</a>.
